ðŸ“¢ Main Release - OSS Compliance & SBOM Automation (Syft + SCANOSS)
Summary
This project provides a fully automated solution for OSS Compliance and SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation using Syft, SCANOSS, and GitHub Actions.
It enables scanning source code, generating SBOMs, detecting open-source licenses, and compiling a final compliance report automatically.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Automatic OSS License Detection

Combines license detection from Syft and SCANOSS.

SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) Generation

Uses Syft to produce detailed SPDX-compliant SBOM reports.

Compliance Report Creation

Merges detected licenses into a final Excel report for easy review.

Fully Automated GitHub Actions Workflow

Triggered on push to main branch or manually via Workflow Dispatch.

Multi-Tool Integration

Syft CLI, SCANOSS CLI, and Python scripts combined into one seamless process.

Safe Error Handling

Ensures fallback when SCANOSS results are missing or incomplete.

ðŸ“¦ Outputs Generated
compliance-report.xlsx â€” Final compliance report mapping components to licenses.

syft-sbom.spdx.json â€” Full SBOM generated using Syft.

scanoss-results.json â€” Raw SCANOSS scan results for traceability.

All outputs are available as downloadable artifacts from GitHub Actions.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
Syft (by Anchore)

SCANOSS (Open Source Software Scanning)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD Automation)

Python (pandas, openpyxl)

ðŸ“‹ How It Works
Source code checked out from GitHub.

Maven project built to pull dependencies.

SCANOSS scans source folder (demo/) for license detection.

Syft generates an SBOM from the project source.

Python script merges Syft and SCANOSS results.

Compliance Excel report generated and uploaded.

ðŸ§  Future Enhancements (Optional)
Enrich License Homepage URLs using GitHub APIs.

Add Risk/Severity scoring based on license types.

Generate reports in additional formats (e.g., PDF, HTML).
